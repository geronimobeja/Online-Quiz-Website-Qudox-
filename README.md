# Online-Quiz-Website-Qudox-

Qudox is an interactive website designed to help users sharpen their skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through fun and engaging quizzes. We've focused on creating a comfortable and user-friendly design, making sure that navigation is simple and intuitive. Qudox was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—our very first project hosted on GitHub. While it’s not fully functional yet, since we’ve mainly focused on the visual design, it marks the exciting beginning of our web development journey.
